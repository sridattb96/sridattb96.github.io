						<p>This is one of my first memories with you, and one of my most favorite. We went to Shlok’s place to turn up one night, and that’s also when I met a lot of your friends. We both had a good time and a couple of drinks, and finally headed back to your place. We were pretty tipsy and super lovey-dovey as we crossed the bridge over 113, and I miss that moment so so much. I still think of the way you smiled at me that night and I die on the inside every time. </p>

						<p>We went to Manhattan Beach the Sunday after Jhoomti Shaam, and we were only a few months into our relationship. I remember when we sat down next to each other and looked at the sea, and Venk even passed by us and said “Goals.” And to this day, I think we truly are goals, not to mention a power couple of everything music + cs + a ton more. I think we’re pretty unstoppable together, and I don’t think that’s going to change in the future. </p>
